In Theorem 4.25, we learned that the hydroxination of the Scebulon
reduction resulted in a diminution of 4.36 inifinities.

We can increase the number of infinities diminished to 10.337 by use
of the least-squares algorithm on the underlying Vogor group within an
Abelian distribution.  However, that approach can cause a catastrophic
explosion which rould wipe out all life on Earth, so it is not
advisable.
